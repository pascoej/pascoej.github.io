          In the summer of 2017, my friends and I bought an inflatable
          boat to use in the Foster City Lagoon.

          The boat was nice, but paddling against wind was a pain. To fix this
          problem I found a wooden pole in my closet, printed out a motor mount
          and prop, and created this:

          Usually I'd be concerned to put the motor in water due to rust, but
          with some grease and spinning out of water after each run to dry it
          out I figured it be fine. The 3d printed prop kept breaking/bending, so thicker
          and thicker prop designs were used.

          With this in mind we tested in the lagoon!

          You'd never tell it wasn't part of the boat in the first place.

          It handles about 40-50 amps continous with the motor controller at a
          decent temp. The limiting factor was that the motor being used was fairly
          high kv, so it couldn't spin up nearly it's design rpm and was limited by
          current.
