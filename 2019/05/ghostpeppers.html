    <h2>Ghost Peppers</h2>
    <p>
      I've always been a fan of spicy food, sometimes to my dismay. I've eaten
      ghost pepper products a few times in spicy food challenges, but never the
      raw pepper. So I decided to grow some.

      Unfortunately, the climate and weather of San Francisco isn't exactly
      conductive to growing them, so I decided to grow them indoors in our spare
      bedroom. So I bought some seeds and set off on this adventure.

    <h3>Germination</h3>
    <p>
      I was pretty worried about germination because I read that ghost pepper
      seeds are difficult to germinate and can take a month. So I ended up using
      the paper towel method and a Raspberry Pi Zero with a temperature sensor,
      combined with a space heater connected to a smart plug to regulate the
      tempature to the 80-90F that I read was required for germination. At this
      point, light wasn't important, so I didn't have any real lights other than
      the one in the closet.

      Once they were growing too big for the paper bags, I transferred them to
      these small seed starters that I got from home depot and bought a 40w grow
      light to encourage them to grow more. This worked great until they outgrew
      the seed starters. I then got a plastic container from Ikea and some cups
      for the next stage of growth. I've been keeping them with 12 hours of
      light a day, and still regulating the temperature of the closet they are
      in to a nice 75-80f.

      From the looks of things it looks like I'll need to get another, bigger
      container soon. I'll post updates when they start to bear peppers. Setting
      up a livestream in the box is a fun idea too that I might explore.

      With fertilizer, they've been going strong for a while now. I got a new
      ~200-300w led bulb and moved them to a bigger closet. They are just
      starting to bud.
